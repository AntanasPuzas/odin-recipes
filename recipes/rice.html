        Here's how to boil long-grain rice on the stovetop! It's an easy, foolproof method that works with white or
        brown
        long-grain rice. Great as simple side dish for any weeknight meal.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup long-grain white or brown rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with water and add the rice:
            The rice should be covered by several inches of water (use a 1:4 ratio of rice to water if you're nervous).
            If using, add at least 1 teaspoon of salt per cup of rice. Stir a few times to make sure the rice and water
            are mixed.</li>
        <li> Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer:
            Let the water come to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat until it maintains a gentle bubbling simmer.</li>
        <li>
            Cook the rice until barely tender:
            White rice will cook in roughly 10 to 15 minutes. Brown rice will cook in roughly 20 to 30 minutes. Stir the
            rice a few times during cooking, when you remember. Taste it as you get toward the end of cooking to test
            its doneness. It's ready when tender and no longer crunchy, but still a touch too firm for your liking.</li>
        <li> Drain the rice:
            Set the strainer over your sink or a large bowl and strain the rice and cooking liquid. (The cooking liquid
            can be saved for other cooking projects.)
            Shake the strainer a few times to fully drain the rice.</li>
        <li> Return to the pot, cover, and let stand:
            Immediately after straining, while the rice is still hot and steamy, transfer the rice back to the pot and
            cover with the lid. Let stand off the heat, for 10 to 15 minutes. The steam from hot rice trapped in the pan
            will finish cooking the rice and help give it a perfect texture.</li>
        <li> Fluff and serve:
            Uncover the rice, fluff with a fork, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
